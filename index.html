                    3. Let me introduce myself. My name is Andrey. I’m 22 years old. I was born in Soligorsk, but now live in Minsk. 
                    I was graduated from the university and worked as an sales manager at the eshops. 
                    My work experience accounts 5 years. 
                    What concerns my character and skills, I’m very hard-working, responsible, diligent, and social person with a good sense of humor. 
                    In my spare time, I’m crazy about video games and bicycles. That’s all all about myself.
